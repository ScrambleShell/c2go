If you wish to help out, here is one way:

1. Enter the "doesnotworkyet" directory
1. Select a c file
1. Type `../try.sh name`, where name is the filename before ".c"
1. Observe the error messages when the generated Go file doesn't compile
1. Edit the Go file to make it compile again
1. Edit c2go.py to make it generate a Go file that does compile for the given test case
1. Create a pull request
